      "description": "The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources has issued an Air\nQuality Advisory for the following counties: Columbia, Dane,\nDodge, Fond du Lac, Green, Green Lake, Iowa, Jefferson, Kenosha,\nLafayette, Marquette, Milwaukee, Ozaukee, Racine, Rock, Sauk,\nSheboygan, Walworth, Washington, Waukesha.\n\nWHAT...The PM2.5 AQI is expected to reach the Unhealthy for\nSensitive Groups (USG) to Unhealthy level.\n\nWHERE...All of Wisconsin.\n\nWHEN...Until noon Thursday, July 31.\n\nPrecautionary/Preparedness Actions:\nSensitive groups: Consider rescheduling or moving all activities\ninside. Go inside if you have symptoms.\n\nPeople with asthma: Follow your asthma action plan and keep\nquick-relief medicine handy.\n\nPeople with heart disease: Symptoms such as palpitations,\nshortness of breath, or unusual fatigue may indicate a serious\nproblem. If you have any of these, contact your health care\nprovider.\n\nEveryone else: Keep outdoor activities shorter and less intense.\nGo inside if you have symptoms.\n\nAdditional Details:\nCanadian wildfire smoke will impact Wisconsin's surface air\nquality over the coming days, causing the PM2.5 Air Quality Index\n(AQI) to range from the Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups (USG;\nOrange) category to the Unhealthy (Red) category. It will be\npossible for NowCast AQI values to reach the Very Unhealthy\n(Purple) category.\n\nSmoke impacts are already being observed in northern Wisconsin on\nTuesday morning, and the smoke is expected to slowly travel south\nthrough northern Wisconsin Tuesday. Overnight Tuesday into\nWednesday morning, the smoke will continue south, impacting most\nof the state by noon Wednesday. The smoke is then expected to\nlinger over the state from noon Wednesday until noon Thursday. We\nmay see brief improvements in air quality on Thursday before\nsmoke moves back into northern areas on Friday. Stay tuned to the\nair quality forecast as conditions can change quickly during\nwildfire smoke events.\n\nFor more information on current air quality, please see:\nhttps://airquality.wi.gov",
